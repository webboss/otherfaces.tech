      content: `\n<p><strong>Can you share details about the city you grew up in, your educational background, and your aspirations for the future?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Ekwutosi Cynthia, and I was born in Enugu Nsukka, but I moved to Makurdi to live with my uncle during my early years. Eventually, I returned to Nsukka for my secondary and university education. Although I studied literature in university, I was initially interested in studying law. However, I couldn&#8217;t imagine leaving Nsukka and my family to study law in Kogi State. After completing my education, I served in the Bayelsa State Ministry of Education, where I had my first experience working in the IT department. This sparked my interest in technology and led me to explore cloud computing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following my service, I faced a turning point in my life when my father passed away. As the eldest sibling among eight, I took on the responsibility of becoming an adult and providing for my family. I relocated to Lagos and found a job in real estate, but I felt unfulfilled and desired a career change. That&#8217;s when I stumbled upon cloud computing through an online video and became fascinated by it. Cloud computing wasn&#8217;t widely known in Nigeria at the time, but I saw an opportunity to learn and excel in this emerging field.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I pursued my interest in cloud computing by seeking employment in the IT industry. With the help of a friend, I landed a job in a cloud computing company in Nigeria. Initially, my role focused on technical customer support, troubleshooting issues, and escalating problems as needed. Determined to excel in my new field, I dedicated myself to learning and improving my skills. I sought guidance from colleagues and took additional courses to expand my knowledge. Over time, I became known within the company for my dedication and expertise. Eventually, I felt it was time to move on, and through a series of events, I found myself in a customer success role, providing support and ensuring customer satisfaction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, my journey has been one of self-discovery, growth, and adapting to new challenges. I&#8217;ve learned the importance of seizing opportunities, being proactive in acquiring new skills, and staying true to my ambitions. From studying literature to venturing into cloud computing, each step has shaped my professional path and brought me closer to fulfilling my aspirations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What skills should one be gathering before diving straight into a role like Customer Success, especially when they&#8217;re just getting started?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my experience, I have noticed that teachers often have success transitioning into customer success roles due to their training and onboarding skills. Personally, as a teacher myself, I have worked with more than three international companies and witnessed this trend. Customer success involves conducting trainings, onboarding clients, and organizing meetings. If you have a background in project management with a touch of teaching, it can be a great advantage. Starting in customer service is a common entry point, allowing you to build your portfolio and gain patience and knowledge. As a customer service representative, you can also seek opportunities to enhance your skills, such as taking courses in project management or collaborating with other teams like sales and product support. By accumulating these diverse skills and experiences, you can eventually apply for a junior customer success manager role. Initially, you may need to learn the ropes and shadow an experienced manager, but over time, you will gain independence and responsibility, handling calls, writing reports, and eventually conducting meetings on your own. It&#8217;s important to note that customer success is distinct from customer support, and starting somewhere, even in a different role, is a valuable stepping stone towards a successful customer success career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do founders of software as a service startups often mix up the roles within their company due to resource constraints, where they actually require customer success but end up combining it with other responsibilities?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Personally, I really enjoy working with startups because they appreciate even the smallest contributions. However, I&#8217;ve noticed that the issue of muddled roles is more common in Nigeria compared to other countries. It seems that Nigerian HR departments often lack a clear understanding of job roles, combining multiple responsibilities into one and offering low salaries. In my experience, it&#8217;s crucial for Nigerian CEOs to invest in professionals who have a solid grasp of different job roles and responsibilities. They should consider hiring specialists or even bringing in someone to establish proper role structures within the company. This investment would greatly benefit the overall effectiveness and success of the organization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What keeps you going in your career?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My motivation has never been solely focused on money because I believe that if money is your only drive, you&#8217;ll end up frustrated. IT and similar fields don&#8217;t always pay you when you expect them to. If money is your ultimate goal, you may lose focus and constantly chase the next big thing. Instead, I strive to learn and excel in my field. When people recognize my expertise and recommend me, that&#8217;s when opportunities come rushing in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had a situation where someone tried to take advantage of me financially. They wanted to employ me for far less than what we initially agreed upon. I found it unfair and decided not to proceed. However, over time, the same person approached me for other opportunities, and I made sure to negotiate on my own terms. I realized that putting skills and expertise first is crucial, as it establishes your authority and attracts genuine recognition, rather than being a jack of all trades. I&#8217;ve invested heavily in certifications and continuous learning, even during the lockdown, without knowing where it would lead. I believed that someday it would all make sense, and now I have my own venture, Digital Witch, where people associate my name with expertise in the field.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What was your inspiration and motivation to start the digital witch community?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I first started Digital Witch, my vision was focused on creating a supportive community specifically for women. You know, I shared my personal story about losing my dad and how my mom, as a stay-at-home mom, faced immense challenges. Trust me, being the eldest child in an African setting automatically meant I had to take on a motherly role, and let me tell you, it wasn&#8217;t an easy situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I wanted to make a difference and provide these amazing women with valuable skills. I realized that many people weren&#8217;t taking online learning seriously, even when I offered free courses and tried to encourage them. It was disheartening, to say the least. But then, one day, I took to Facebook and asked if any women were interested in learning from me. The response was overwhelming! I decided to charge a fee for the training and poured my heart into creating valuable content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you know what? It paid off. The impact was beyond anything I could have imagined. After the training, several women from that first class landed jobs within just two weeks. Others started getting interviews and promising opportunities. It was such a proud moment for me when I shared their success stories on social media. But, of course, there were some who criticized me for focusing exclusively on women. They thought it was unfair. So, I opened the doors to everyone who wanted to join, regardless of gender.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As time went on, our community blossomed. Month after month, more and more students joined, and the results were incredible. We grew from a small group of 30 to over a thousand students within a few months. Can you believe it? I was both excited and overwhelmed by the response. At times, I worried about how I would manage such a large group, but seeing the impact we were making kept me going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, if you check out platforms like LinkedIn, you&#8217;ll notice a wave of fresh faces, and guess what? The majority of them are my students! They&#8217;ve landed jobs as virtual assistants, customer support professionals, appointment setters, and tele marketers. It&#8217;s amazing to witness how this community has empowered them to achieve their dreams. And let me tell you about the &#8220;japa&#8221; trend. Once they started earning a decent income, many of them are now considering relocating to places like the UK. It&#8217;s truly a testament to the positive impact of Digital Witch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeing these individuals thrive and succeed fills me with so much joy and satisfaction. It&#8217;s the human connections, the stories of personal growth, and the dreams becoming a reality that make every effort worthwhile. Digital Witch has become more than just a training programâ€”it&#8217;s a tight-knit community that supports and uplifts each other. And I can&#8217;t wait to see what the future holds for all of us.</p>\n`,

        "\n<p><strong>What was growing up like for you?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Growing up was interesting and a mixture of good and bad times. I lost my father in 2012, which occurred during my transition from secondary school to university. To be honest, it really didnâ€™t click at the time. I had a passion for playing football and was actively involved in sports throughout secondary school. After my father&#8217;s passing, I spent a few years at home before gaining admission to Lagos State Polytechnic, where I studied Urban and Regional planning even though I had wanted to study Political Science at the University of Benin. Alongside my studies, I pursued music, particularly playing the keyboard for church. After finishing school, I developed an interest in photography and learned the craft. I eventually recognized my inclination towards product management and began building a product-oriented business in Ghana and South Africa in 2017. Initially unaware of the term &#8220;product management,&#8221; my role involved actively engaging with customers, collecting feedback, and incorporating it into my work. I later transitioned into marketing communications before returning to product management. Currently, I work as the lead product manager at DASHOUT and co-founded Enoverlab, a product management training institute. They are also involved in undisclosed projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What did you want to be when you grow up?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for the question. When I was younger, I had dreams of becoming a pilot, and that desire still lingers in my mind today. Music was also a passion of mine, especially playing the drums in the children&#8217;s church. I remember breaking my mom&#8217;s buckets, and she used to jokingly tell me that I would have to buy new ones when I grew up. Alongside music, I aspired to be a movie director, drawn to the artistic expression it offered. This artistic inclination led me to explore photography, marketing communications, and even building products without realizing I was doing product management back in 2017. Although I temporarily stopped pursuing music actively, I still enjoy playing the keyboard and dabbling in music production. Looking back, I realize that these passions have always been a part of me, and I hope that in the future, when I have achieved financial success, I can delve into music, movie directing, and even fulfill my childhood dream of flying. It&#8217;s fascinating to see how life has unfolded, and I&#8217;m excited to continue exploring these creative avenues as time goes on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Your Career Path</strong>?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To start off, I must admit that my career path wasn&#8217;t planned or based on vibes alone. It was more like going with the flow. For example, I stumbled into music when a friend introduced me to playing the keyboard, which eventually led me to learn photography and then venture into writing and marketing communications. The opportunity to build a product in Ghana and attract customers from South Africa was another unexpected turn, but I embraced the learning curve and found guidance from mentors along the way. One mentor suggested I explore product management, and after researching and considering my skills, I delved into it in 2020. Since then, I&#8217;ve been actively engaged in product management while also contributing my marketing expertise to various projects. It hasn&#8217;t been a straightforward journey, but the guidance of mentors has played a crucial role in shaping my career. In summary, my career path has been a blend of seizing opportunities, going with the flow, and being fortunate to have supportive mentors who have been integral to my professional growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why did you start Enoverlab?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hmm, okay. So, um, I started Enoverlab in 2021 after working as a product manager and sharing my experiences on LinkedIn. One person, Ibukun, a former GT Bank employee who had relocated to Canada, reached out to me for insights on product management. He mentioned that GT Bank&#8217;s product management lacked structure, leading to the underperformance of their Habari app. This sparked my interest in teaching product management to others. I noticed a growing demand for learning product management, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, but existing training centers were expensive. This led me to establish Enoverlab, with the goal of providing affordable and structured product management training. Initially, it started as one-on-one sessions, but we eventually expanded to a classroom setup. Enoverlab was officially registered in September, although we had been active since May. Over the past three years, we have trained over 2000 individuals, with around 65% of them currently working as product managers worldwide. I am proud of our achievements and grateful for the opportunity to make a difference. It&#8217;s important to note that I co-founded Enoverlab with my wife, who had previous experience in product design and worked with me to build the company alongside our other venture, Perxels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What advise would you give to new product managers?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When advising new project managers on networking and finding mentors, I stress the importance of patience, service, and humility. Many young professionals lack patience and the willingness to put in the effort to learn, often expecting immediate results. Sharing my own experience with a mentor whom I&#8217;ve never met in person, I highlight the value of providing genuine service and support without expecting anything in return. Building a mentor-mentee relationship takes time and investment, and being transparent about one&#8217;s intentions from the start is crucial. It&#8217;s essential to recognize that successful individuals have likely dedicated years of service and humility to achieve their goals. Active listening and absorbing insights from mentors are also vital for personal and professional growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What advice would you give to your younger self?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I could give advice to my younger self, I would emphasize the importance of learning quickly and implementing ideas promptly. Looking back five years ago, I realize that the more I took action and made mistakes, the more I learned and accomplished. Often, we get caught up in overthinking and analysis paralysis, trying to make the perfect decision or weighing the pros and cons endlessly. However, I&#8217;ve come to understand that learning from both successes and failures happens when we swiftly put our knowledge into practice. By continuously learning, implementing, and iterating, we can gradually improve every aspect of our lives, leading to exponential growth. Reflecting on this, I imagine the potential if I had started implementing the things I&#8217;m working on now four years ago. I would likely be three or four times further ahead than where I am today. Therefore, my advice to my younger self is simple: Learn quickly, implement quickly, and repeat the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Any final words?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Closing remarks would be to encourage anyone out there, regardless of their profession, to embrace the philosophy of learning quickly and implementing quickly. From my experience training individuals to become product managers, those who displayed a relentless drive to learn and apply their knowledge swiftly stood out and achieved remarkable success. These individuals surpassed their peers in securing better job opportunities and experiencing rapid career growth. They were always eager to learn, ask questions, and take action. I&#8217;ve witnessed firsthand how these individuals excelled and obtained prestigious positions in renowned organizations. Therefore, my final words of advice to everyone, whether you&#8217;re a product manager, designer, analyst, or marketer, is to prioritize rapid learning and immediate implementation. By doing so, you will accelerate your personal and professional growth. Thank you.</p>\n",

        "\n<p><strong>What was your experience like growing up in terms of the city you grew up in, your educational background, and your family dynamics?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I grew up in a conservative home where I spent a lot of time indoors as a child, watching cartoons and discovering my passion for drawing at a young age. My dad was the one who noticed my talent and encouraged me to pursue it. He supported me as I sketched family trees and various artworks. However, when I turned eight, my dad passed away, and my mom insisted that I focus solely on my studies, believing that drawing couldn&#8217;t provide a stable career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During my secondary school years, my mom and I often clashed due to my stubbornness and my desire to continue drawing. She limited my artistic activities to holidays, while emphasizing the importance of education. It was during this time that my mom bought computer monitors, and I began exploring graphic design using programs like CorelDraw and PowerPoint. Despite the limitations imposed on my artistic pursuits, I honed my skills by watching YouTube tutorials on graphic design and digital painting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After recovering from a serious accident that left me in a coma for over a week, I had a heartfelt conversation with my mom about my career aspirations. She agreed to let me make my own choices, and that marked the beginning of my journey into digital illustration. I ordered my first drawing tablet and immersed myself in online tutorials, seeking guidance from experienced Nigerian artists. Without access to formal schools specializing in digital art in my area, I knew I needed to move to Lagos, the hub of artistic opportunities in Nigeria.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Continuing to practice and seek feedback from mentors, I eventually gained recognition. An agency in Lagos offered me an internship, providing valuable experience and further improving my skills. Since then, from 2016 to the present day, I have dedicated myself to developing my artistic abilities and witnessing continuous improvement along the way. It has been a transformative journey that has brought me to where I am today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are your thoughts on giving and receiving feedback for junior designers?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe that negative feedback tends to stick with people more than positive feedback. Some individuals may not take action or make improvements when feedback is given in a gentle and supportive manner. However, I have found that being blunt and direct can be an effective way to motivate people. When mentors or role models provide harsh feedback, they are often testing your commitment and determination. They want to see if you have the motivation to prove them wrong and if you truly have a passion for what you&#8217;re doing. Initially, you may resent the person for their blunt words, but eventually, you will realize that their criticism was valid. You may even feel grateful and want to thank them for pushing you to improve. In the real world, clients can be even harsher in their feedback, and it&#8217;s important to learn how to handle and learn from it. In the tech and creative industry, many of us are self-taught or learn through online resources, often neglecting the business and interpersonal aspects. Feedback and criticism play a crucial role in our growth and success. So, when someone pushes you and appears harsh, it&#8217;s not because they hate you, but because they want to see you rise to the challenge. It&#8217;s important to embrace these opportunities and prove yourself. From my experience, those who initially disliked me for my comments eventually became my closest allies. They transformed their lives by taking my feedback to heart, pursuing education and growth, and finding their passion in their careers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Have you at any point thought of alternative careers asides drawing and digital illustrations?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, I have multiple options for my career path, but my true passion lies in farming. Alongside my job in graphic design, I have already established a farm because agriculture is something I genuinely love. While I enjoy design, farming is a hobby and an additional source of fulfillment for me. It&#8217;s important to prioritize the career that brings in income, and at the moment, graphic design is the primary source. However, farming remains a significant part of my life and I don&#8217;t envision pursuing any other career apart from agriculture, or perhaps politics. Other options simply don&#8217;t hold my interest or fit into my schedule at this point in my life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How did you stay motivated and on track to grow and become as skilled as you are today, especially considering the initial limitations of pursuing a design or digital painting career in Nigeria?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. Well, when I first started my journey, there were moments of doubt. I questioned myself, wondering if I was making the right choice. It was especially challenging coming from a background where people around me didn&#8217;t believe in what I was doing. They saw it as laziness or a reluctance to face the real world and its challenges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I distinctly remember my mom expressing her disappointment, saying she had lost hope in me because I seemed to be going down an uncertain path. Although they may not have directly said it, I could feel the lack of support and the sense that they had given up on me. These circumstances led me to doubt myself even more. I questioned whether pursuing a career in design would bring me the success I desired.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that point, I made a decision. I told myself, &#8220;Let me give it a few years. If it doesn&#8217;t work out, I can always take it up as a hobby and find something else.&#8221; But as time went on, I realized that no matter what other options I explored, I always found myself coming back to design. It was what truly made me happy, and I couldn&#8217;t ignore that fact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, in 2018, I had the opportunity to embark on an internship in the industry. That experience turned out to be a turning point for me. As I worked with professionals and witnessed the inner workings of design agencies, I was motivated by the creative energy and the potential to make a real impact. Seeing the projects they were involved in and the financial rewards they earned further solidified my determination.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why I always encourage young aspiring designers to seek out internships, regardless of their self-taught skills. It is crucial to face the real world, work as part of a team, and learn from experienced professionals. The lessons and insights gained during an internship are invaluable, teaching you the importance of teamwork, time management, and effective communication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I must emphasize that internships are not just about the technical skills you acquire but also the opportunities for personal growth and networking. During my internships, I worked with various studios and companies, sometimes offering my services for free. I was willing to invest my time and effort to learn and grow, and this dedication made a significant impression on those I worked with. I was entrusted with responsibilities, and some studios even offered me full-time positions with attractive salaries. However, I chose to continue seeking new experiences and learning opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, I work as a freelancer, and I have the freedom to work from home. I have honed my skills as a creative director, completing tasks on time and collaborating effectively with clients and colleagues. I have come a long way from those early days when doubts and skepticism surrounded my choice of career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, I am thrilled to see more and more women entering the design industry. When I first started, female representation was minimal, particularly in areas like 3D animation. I consciously sought to explore different avenues and challenge traditional gender roles in design. Now, as an established professional, I am proud to be part of a more inclusive industry where talented individuals can thrive, regardless of their gender.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, to all aspiring designers and artists out there, I urge you to consider internships as a crucial step in your journey. Embrace the opportunity to work alongside industry professionals, learn from their expertise, and develop important skills that go beyond what can be learned online. Internships provide real-world experiences, connections, and friendships that can shape your future and contribute to your success in the dynamic world of design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What would you say about people coming into the design industry for the money?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you very much. People often have misconceptions when entering the design industry. Many are attracted by the idea of making easy money, seeing others succeed and buy new gadgets, all while working from the comfort of their homes. They think they can learn a course, finish it, and start earning right away. But that&#8217;s not how it works. In fact, I&#8217;ve even offered to work for free during internships just to gain experience and learn from professionals. Many were surprised that I took the initiative and expressed admiration for my courage. It can be overwhelming at times, but it&#8217;s essential to prioritize skill development over monetary gain. Working under pressure is another aspect that people underestimate. When you&#8217;re part of an advertising agency, the demands can be intense. The speed and quality of your work matter, and over time, you learn to become more efficient. Collaboration is crucial, too. When everyone in the team contributes their expertise, projects get completed faster and more effectively. These experiences prepare you for freelancing, where you have to manage client expectations and deliver within deadlines. If you can&#8217;t handle the pressure or communicate your capabilities, it becomes challenging to succeed as a freelancer. I&#8217;ve also discovered that networking and referrals play a significant role in securing jobs. While platforms like LinkedIn and Upwork are popular, I&#8217;ve found success through Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. Posting my work there often leads to direct inquiries from potential clients. Referrals from satisfied clients have become a valuable source of income for me. It&#8217;s important to understand that success in the industry is not solely based on talent but also on building connections and a solid reputation. It takes time and experience to establish yourself and earn what you deserve. So, don&#8217;t rush into it expecting quick money. Focus on developing your skills and gaining real-world experience through internshipsâ€”it will pay off in the long run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How did you become one of the most influential people at Naija Graphic Designers?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>During my journey in the design field, I had the opportunity to join the NGD (Naija Graphic Designers) community. It was around 2017 when I started, and I was looking for a place to meet other graphic designers and expand my skills. I initially joined as a member, but I was mostly in the background, observing and learning from the posts and discussions. It wasn&#8217;t until late 2017 when I mustered the courage to share my work. I posted it on the group, and to my surprise, it was approved. That was a significant moment for me, as it gave me a sense of validation and encouraged me to become more involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As time went on, I became more active in the community, and in 2019, I noticed some areas that could be improved. I took the initiative to create a new cover page illustration for NGD, which received positive feedback from the founder, Emeka. Impressed by my dedication and contributions, Emeka offered me an admin role within the group. This opportunity allowed me to take on more responsibilities and make a meaningful impact on the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an admin, I recognized the need for increased engagement and participation within the group. I reached out to members, asked for their input and suggestions, and even organized giveaways to incentivize activity. I budgeted a portion of my salary for these giveaways, and Emeka supported me by providing additional resources when needed. Slowly but surely, the group started to thrive, and the number of members grew exponentially. It was incredible to witness the community&#8217;s progress and know that I played a part in its success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NGD became more than just a Facebook group to me. It became a source of inspiration, a place where I made lasting friendships, and a platform that helped me grow both personally and professionally. I am immensely grateful for the opportunities and experiences I&#8217;ve had within NGD. It has shaped my journey as a designer and given me the confidence to pursue my passion further. As a proud partner of the NGD brand, I am committed to seeing the community flourish and empowering others to find their path within the design world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>As a creative director, what factors do you consider before hiring a designer for a project?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to designs and illustrations, I prioritize reviewing the portfolio to gauge a designer&#8217;s strengths and areas for improvement. If I find that someone&#8217;s art style or design approach doesn&#8217;t align with the specific project I have in mind, I may not hire them. I value adaptability and versatility in designers, as some can easily fit into any style with guidance, while others remain fixed in their preferred style. Having had diverse experiences and internships, I have developed various art styles but always aim to understand the concept, style, and design approach of a project to ensure harmony within the team and avoid conflicting styles. Versatility is a trait I appreciate, but for projects requiring specific styles, I would seek out specialists in those areas. Ultimately, I consider a designer&#8217;s skills and strengths, taking into account their impact on workflow and project timelines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How do you handle creative block?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve learned that when I experience creative block, it&#8217;s a sign that I need to upgrade and take a break. During these times, I inform my team and build strong relationships with clients, explaining the situation. Since I love traveling, I embark on road trips to local places to seek inspiration. Exploring different countries and cities allows me to observe design trends and elements, such as logos, that are popular in those areas. It stimulates my thinking and generates new ideas. When traveling isn&#8217;t possible, I turn to platforms like Pinterest, ArtStation, and Instagram to immerse myself in other artists&#8217; work. Spending time on these platforms fills my mind with creative content, and before I know it, ideas start flowing again. I believe designers should make Pinterest their go-to app for daily inspiration and keep exploring various artistic communities. It has proven to be a valuable resource for reigniting my creative juices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are the problems creatives face in Nigeria?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our community, I often conduct surveys to understand the challenges faced by designers. Lack of amenities like electricity, access to physical learning spaces, and reliable internet are major issues they encounter. Many designers have expressed the desire for graphic design to be included in university curricula. To address these challenges, we provide solutions and support designers in our community. We invest money into initiatives that benefit them, such as challenges and talent grooming programs. Our goal is to boost the community and recommend skilled designers to clients when opportunities arise. Additionally, we recognize the need for essential equipment like laptops, internet access, and electricity. Through fundraising efforts, we have provided systems, laptops, and even generators to talented individuals who lacked these resources. By addressing these core needs, we aim to alleviate major obstacles faced by designers and empower them to succeed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What do you see as the impact of AI in the creative industry?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe AI is here to stay, and as a designer, I think it&#8217;s important to utilize AI to enhance our work. AI can help with faster turnaround times, but I&#8217;m not worried about it affecting my art style. My unique artistic style cannot be copied by AI, and clients value the human touch and creativity in my work. While AI has its benefits, I focus on creating art that AI cannot replicate, infusing it with my personal perspective and cultural background. AI should be seen as a tool to complement and enhance our designs, rather than something to fear. Copyright issues surrounding AI-generated content need to be addressed, and big brands must be cautious about using AI to avoid potential legal consequences. Ultimately, the future lies in our ability to creatively utilize AI while preserving our individuality as artists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How can creatives deepen their network?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my experience, the best way to network and connect with people in the graphic design industry in Nigeria is through Naija Graphic Design (NGD). It&#8217;s a great platform where I&#8217;ve connected with many like-minded creatives. Additionally, attending conferences, events, and creative gatherings has been beneficial for networking. I&#8217;ve also found online communities such as Discord, Facebook, Twitter, and ArtStation to be valuable for connecting with people in the industry. As someone who tends to be introverted, these online spaces have provided opportunities to showcase my work and attract clients. In particular, exploring the web three space has been fruitful, as I&#8217;ve secured more jobs in that field. It&#8217;s important to actively engage in various events, share your expertise, and always be ready to pitch yourself and your services. Offering solutions to problems and positioning yourself as a professional can help you build a strong network and find new opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How do you recalibrate?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a creative, it&#8217;s important to prioritize your health and well-being. Taking care of yourself physically and mentally is crucial. I&#8217;ve learned the hard way that neglecting my health can negatively impact my work. So now I make sure to incorporate activities like walking, fitness, and participating in social events that interest me. Attending parties and gatherings with a diverse crowd has allowed me to network and pitch myself to potential clients. Additionally, finding different activities outside of work, such as traveling or exploring hobbies like agriculture, helps me refresh my mind and stay inspired.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s essential to avoid unnecessary stress and not get caught up in seeking validation through social media metrics like likes and comments. Instead, I focus on my goals and the reason I entered this industry. I&#8217;ve realized that it&#8217;s not about the quantity of work but rather the value and income it brings. By setting my worth and staying focused on projects that align with my goals, I&#8217;ve been able to attract clients who appreciate my skills and pay accordingly. I also take advantage of free time by engaging in self-study, personal projects, and creating templates or products that I can sell as side gigs. By investing in myself and constantly evolving, I&#8217;ve seen the financial potential that exists within the creative industry.</p>\n",

        '\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-plain">\n<p>Jephtah, with seven years of tech experience, founded Talentpoel, connecting African non-tech talent with US and European tech companies.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What was growing up like for you, city you grew up in, and your educational background</strong>?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I have quite a peculiar story, especially when it comes to growing up. I&#8217;ve lived in three different places, mainly Lagos and Port Harcourt. I was born in Lagos, specifically in Ilupeju, and then I moved to Port Harcourt before eventually returning to Lagos. One thing I&#8217;ve never mentioned before is that during my time in university, I attended more than four different universities because I kept changing courses. I was incredibly confused and unsure of what I wanted to pursue. It all started with the pressure to study mechanical engineering, as many Nigerian parents expect. I got admission to study ICT in Covenant University but ended up not going. Then I decided to pursue medicine and enrolled in the University of Lagos, but they offered me a course in anatomy instead, and I was determined to study medicine. I tried my luck at Bowen University, but still didn&#8217;t get the desired course. At one point, I even traveled abroad to study biomedical engineering, but eventually realized it wasn&#8217;t for me either. These experiences spanned over a period of around three years, during which I attended four different schools and changed courses multiple times. While most of my peers were already graduating, I realized that the traditional education system wasn&#8217;t the right fit for me. I expressed to my mom that I wanted to become a &#8220;dropout millionaire&#8221; and start my own business. However, she insisted that I needed a degree.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I eventually enrolled in Wellspring University in Benin, where I discovered my interest in computer science. My sister had been working in the tech industry since 2014, and witnessing her success and the opportunities it provided intrigued me. I began exploring tech in 2016 and started working as a social media manager while still in school. Although I had little knowledge or experience, I managed to acquire clients and earn some income. But as time went on, I realized I needed to expand my skills and knowledge. I delved into digital marketing, cybersecurity, community management, and various other areas within the tech industry. Now, after seven years in the field, I have gained experience in multiple domains, ranging from front-end development to content marketing, social media management, cybersecurity, and more. I&#8217;ve always had a passion for learning, and being surrounded by tech-savvy individuals has fueled my desire to continuously expand my knowledge. This diverse journey has led me to where I am today, as a founder of my own company. It&#8217;s been quite an interesting and eventful story, to say the least.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Are you unafraid to forge new paths, always willing to pursue new opportunities even if uncertainty arises, and how do you navigate these transitions and changes in roles over the years?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was a great question, and from my perspective, I consider myself the most adventurous person I know. I forgot to mention earlier that I&#8217;m also an author, and if you Google me, you&#8217;ll find some books I&#8217;ve written. When I set my mind on something, I give it my absolute all. It&#8217;s like if I decide today to become a farmer in Namibia, by evening I&#8217;ll have booked a ticket and be on my way. I think I inherited this trait from my mom. Growing up, I used to dislike her business because it meant less time with us and the challenges she faced. I even told her I could never be an entrepreneur due to the stress. But a few years later, I found myself doing exactly what she does. She&#8217;s constantly evolving. She sold kids&#8217; toys and went on to owning a supermarket. I hate to admit it, but we&#8217;re similar, especially when it comes to our passion. I believe I got that drive from her. For instance, when I left my previous job as a community manager, I was earning $6,000 per month. I could have chosen to continue or even apply for similar positions, knowing I would succeed. Starting a company in the midst of chaos takes courage and bravery, especially when others are facing layoffs. That&#8217;s why I believe Talentpoel, our startup, is remarkableâ€”we launched it in the midst of turmoil and uncertainty in the tech industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How can individuals interested in non-coding careers in the tech industry position themselves and acquire the necessary skills and opportunities?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As someone who has explored various roles in the tech industry, including non-coding careers, I understand the importance of positioning oneself and acquiring the required skills and opportunities. My advice to individuals interested in non-coding roles within the tech industry would be to focus on three key areas: continuous learning, building a diverse skill set, and networking. Embrace a mindset of lifelong learning, actively seeking out resources, courses, and certifications that align with your desired career path. Develop a well-rounded skill set by honing your communication, problem-solving, project management, and analytical abilities, as these are valuable in many non-technical roles. Additionally, leverage networking opportunities to connect with professionals in your target field, attend industry events, join relevant communities, and seek mentorship to gain insights and access to job opportunities. By combining a commitment to learning, a diverse skill set, and a strong network, individuals can position themselves effectively for non-coding roles and navigate the dynamic landscape of the tech industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When is the right time to start putting yourself out there in your career, considering the risks of misrepresentation or lack of expertise?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my honest opinion, I believe that as soon as you begin your career in tech, whether in product design or any other field, it&#8217;s crucial to start putting yourself out there. The tech industry is highly competitive, often overlooking entry-level professionals, which can be challenging. However, authenticity is key. While you may be doing something others have already done, adding your unique twist to it is essential. Peer learning has been valuable to me, especially when senior-level professionals in Nigeria may be less accessible. Reaching out to individuals outside Nigeria has often resulted in better reception and learning opportunities. It&#8217;s important to think about your career path and focus on learning first, then networking. Volunteering and connecting with people in the industry can be a powerful way to learn and grow. I&#8217;ve personally benefitted from my network in starting a company, gaining insights on company registration, fundraising, and more. So, be authentic, prioritize learning, and leverage networking to enhance your tech career journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How can emerging non-tech, non-coding roles in Nigeria or Africa gain the visibility and recognition they deserve, considering that some companies may misunderstand or mislabel these roles, leading to misguided expectations and requirements based on social media metrics?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a great question. I believe the key lies in creating a strong community of non-technical professionals who can educate and advocate for their roles. By banding together and establishing partnerships, brands can organize impactful events and strategies that bring visibility and meaning to emerging non-tech roles in Africa. For instance, if prominent companies like Google collaborate to establish a dedicated community for non-technical roles, it would generate excitement and serve as a platform for learning and collaboration. This unified effort would not only raise awareness but also propel the growth and recognition of non-technical careers in the African tech industry, aligning with the mission of TalentPoel and other initiatives focused on African talent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What was your biggest career challenge or transition?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overcoming imposter syndrome has been the biggest challenge in my career, particularly when transitioning to new roles, as there is often a cultural barrier and a fear of not being deserving or capable. However, I had to remind myself that I possess the skills and intelligence to succeed and that many individuals in influential positions may not necessarily be more knowledgeable than me. Once I overcame this challenge, my mindset shifted, and I became more confident in pursuing my goals and endeavours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>W<strong>hy, when and how were you able to like start your own thing, which is Talentpoel.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Incredible journey! I had attempted a similar venture back in 2017 with a project called Millennial Mind, aimed at creating an ecosystem for tech professionals. However, due to a lack of structure and strategy, it quickly fell apart. Later, while running another startup called padeapp, the vision for Talentpoel came to me. Initially overwhelmed by the idea&#8217;s magnitude, I sought advice from my co-founder and mother, who encouraged me to pursue it. With doubts lingering, a quote on Twitter reaffirmed that great ideas choose you, leading me to officially register Talentpoel in February. Despite facing financial challenges and initial rejections from potential co-founders, the right team gradually came together. Within a few months, we formed valuable partnerships and achieved remarkable progress, which I attribute to God&#8217;s grace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Have your past experiences and roles made your journey as a founder more manageable or efficient?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My past experiences in content creation, social media marketing, customer support, and documentation have played a significant role in making my journey as a founder more manageable and efficient. With my background in both non-technical and technical aspects, I was able to build the Talentpoel website with the help of a friend, leveraging my understanding of design and development. I handle various tasks, including talent vetting, content creation, client outreach, while my team supports me in legal and sales aspects. The combination of these skills and experiences has enabled me to take on the role of a founder and navigate the challenges with confidence and efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What do you envision for the present and future of community managers with the rise of artificial intelligence solutions like ChatGPT and other advanced AI technologies?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the emergence of artificial intelligence solutions like ChatGPT, I see them as valuable assistants rather than replacements for community managers in the present and future. While AI can automate certain tasks like filtering harmful messages and providing automated answers, human touch and interaction are essential in community management, especially in areas like customer support. However, I believe that the role of community managers will evolve and merge with other roles in the next five to ten years, such as integrating social media management responsibilities. The job titles may change, but the importance of community building and engagement will remain significant, as it offers a non-intrusive way of marketing and connecting with customers. Despite some companies undervaluing community roles at the moment, I believe this perception will change as the benefits become more apparent in a saturated marketing landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What advice would you give to your younger self, considering the experiences and knowledge you have gained throughout your journey?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I could give advice to my younger self, I would say to enjoy the journey and embrace every challenge I face. Despite feeling like the only one experiencing setbacks, I now realize that those challenges have shaped my mindset and given me the confidence to embark on entrepreneurial endeavors and lead a team towards a shared vision. I would encourage myself to embrace the ups and downs, allowing myself to cry and rest when needed, knowing that these experiences will ultimately lead to success. Additionally, I would remind myself to prioritize self-care, including regular exercise and maintaining good health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Words of advice?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe that one of the keys to success is having an unwavering belief in yourself and considering yourself the best at what you do. I&#8217;ve observed that many Africans often struggle with an inferiority complex or lack the boldness to assert their abilities. However, I want to emphasize the importance of believing that you are the best person for the job and that you will excel in it. When you possess this mindset, nothing can stop you, even if you face rejection. Allow me to share a funny story: Last year, I applied to Andela, and although I didn&#8217;t get the job, the recruiter personally reached out to me. She mentioned that I was a strong candidate, and what stood out the most was my unmatched confidence level. I gained this confidence not from the salary I was earning or the achievements I had, but from knowing deep down that I am the best fit for any role. The reason I didn&#8217;t get the job was simply because they were looking for someone in a different location, possibly in Latin America. Instead of feeling discouraged, I took it as positive feedback. As a recruiter myself at Talentpoel, I understand that confidence and proactiveness are essential traits. Your confidence level speaks volumes, as it reflects in your body language and overall psyche. Therefore, my advice to my younger self and to anyone is to believe that you are more than good enough. Remove all forms of self-doubt and embrace the mindset that you will excel and be the best. This mentality will take you far, as it did for me and many others who believe in themselves. The only difference between those who have achieved great things and those who haven&#8217;t is that they got the opportunity and made the most of it. So, believe that you are the best and let go of any hesitation or uncertainty. Embrace the attitude that you will conquer and achieve greatness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How did you manage to overcome challenging periods, such as getting laid off or facing rejections, and bounce back to regain your momentum and continue moving forward?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of overcoming challenging periods, I have always maintained a strong sense of confidence and faith in myself. Even when I faced setbacks like getting laid off or experiencing rejection, I approached them with a positive mindset. For example, when I lost my job, I laughed it off and reassured myself that I would find another job within two weeks, and I actually did. I believe in my skills and abilities, and I remain confident in my potential for success. Additionally, I have a deep faith that things will work out for the best and that there are always new opportunities waiting for me. I view challenging experiences as lessons to be learned from and stepping stones towards growth. Instead of dwelling on the losses, I focus on what I can gain from the experience and how I can move forward. This combination of confidence, faith, and a resilient mindset has helped me overcome challenges and keep moving forward in my journey.</p>\n',
